# nrf-experimentsSome experiments with nrf51 board## RPA generator*RPA = Resolvable Private Address*<br>This is the project to generate RPA from our own code without using softdevice functions.**How to run this project** In examples folder of NRF SDK, replace the main.c file in ble\_app\_template project with the given main.c file. That will make sure that the hex file is built according to up-to-date libraries. If you get some error like this:<br>*.\_build\nrf51422_xxac.axf: Error: L6218E: Undefined symbol SEGGER_RTT_printf (referred from main.o).*<br>Add **NRF_LOG_USES_RTT=1**  in pre-processor symbols as shown in the picture below. This symbol is for segger_RTT.![](images/RPA_generation_err?raw=true)**Functions explanation**<br>There are two functions that can be used for RPA generation:**1. RPA\_generation\_and\_set():** This function generates RPA without using softdevice functions and  according to BLE specifications.**2. RPA_config():** This is an alternative function and it uses softdevice functions to set the RPA but the IRK(Identity Resolving key) and RPA refresh interval is given by us.
